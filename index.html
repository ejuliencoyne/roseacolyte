  	<h1>Rose Acolyte Ceramics</h1>
    <p>Hi! You found Julien's placeholder website for a future pottery page!</p>
    <p>For now, the best way to get any info about my pottery, sales, etc, is by <a href="https://buttondown.email/roseacolyte">subscribing to my newsletter</a>. (For those who are already subscribed to "Why Am I Making This?", this is a SEPARATE newsletter. You need to subscribe to this one separately.)</p>
    <p>You can also find me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roseacolyteceramics/">on instagram</a>.</p>
    <p>If you want to get in touch, you can try instagram DMs (which I answer sporadically), or subscribe to the newsletter above and wait for a chance to reply to a missive via email. Sorry in advance that I'm so elusive!</p>
