    <p>Hi! I'm Julien, a potter based in Portland, Maine. I make handbuilt, whimsically-illustrated functional pottery.</p>
    <p>This website is still under construction; hopefully one day you'll be able to come here and look at a gallery of my work. Maybe even buy things in a shop.</p>
    <p>The best way to get any info about my pottery, sales, etc, is by <a href="https://buttondown.email/roseacolyte">subscribing to my newsletter</a>. (For those who are already subscribed to "Why Am I Making This?", this is a SEPARATE newsletter. You need to subscribe to this one separately.)</p>
    <p>You can also find me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roseacolyteceramics/">instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/roseacolyteceramics">tumblr</a>.</p>
    <p>If you want to get in touch, you can try instagram DMs (which I answer sporadically), subscribe to the newsletter above and wait for a chance to reply to a missive via email, or try to guess my pottery email. I'll give you a hint. It's at this domain and it's pretty easy to guess. I may not be the quickest to reply, though - sorry in advance that I'm so elusive!</p>
